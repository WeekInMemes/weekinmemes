&lt;p&gt;Akshay Kumar Schemeposting is a Facebook group that is focused on memes featuring Akshay Kumar. The scheme in Schemeposting is based on Akhsay Kumar&amp;rsquo;s character in the 2007 movie, Phir Hera Pheri (sequel to Hera Pheri). In the movie, Raju (Akshay Kumar) falls for a money-making scheme and then tries to sell similar schemes to other gullible people like Rajpal Yadav as shown in this template:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
