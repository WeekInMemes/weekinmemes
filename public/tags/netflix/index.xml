&lt;p&gt;The government of India&amp;rsquo;s solution to make the lockdown caused by Coronavirus is to bring back old TV shows from the 80s and 90s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prakash Javdekar, the minister for Information and Broadcasting announced on March 27 that Ramayana would be aired everyday at 9 am and 9 pm on DD National. The 2 Hindu epics - Ramayana and Mahabharata - were the most popular shows then and were the most anticipated ones for a generation that grew up watching them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
