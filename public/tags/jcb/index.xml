      <description>&lt;p&gt;The elections are finally over that means Vivek Oberoi&amp;rsquo;s Narendra Modi biopic can be released&amp;hellip; But instead of watching the movie, Indians prefer watching JCB machines dig. Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;origin&#34;&gt;Origin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, no one really knows. What we do know is that Indians are fascinated by the yellow digging machines, specifically the ubiquitous ones sold under the JCB brand. It&amp;rsquo;s like mineral water is &amp;lsquo;Bisleri&amp;rsquo; or photocopy is &amp;lsquo;Xerox&amp;rsquo; in India, these machines are now JCB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 27, 2019, Twitter users almost spontaneously started making memes about this phenomenon of Indians gathering to watch JCB machines at work. Probably it&amp;rsquo;s the lull between 2 big events - Indian elections and the World Cup - that is the cause of this completely random trend. But, the term #JCBKiKhudai was trending on top in India and made to Twitter Moments and even the official JCB handle had to respond:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
