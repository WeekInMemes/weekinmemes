      <description>Origin The gif of Ranveer Singh dancing among Maratha soldiers is taken from the video Malhari from the movie Bajirao Mastani.
  The gif from Malhari has become a popular &amp;lsquo;celebration&amp;rsquo; among the reddit and especially the bitcoin community. As /u/Oracle_of_Knowledge mentions in this comment
 On Bitcoinity.com when there is a new milestone All Time High they will often post a gif. A gif of this (1:26 in the video, his re-entrance) was up on Bitconity for the $4000 USD all time high.</description>
