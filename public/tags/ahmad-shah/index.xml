      <description>Origin A kid from Pakistan has recently become a viral sensation for his video. Watch the video here:
  His name is Ahmad Shah and some are calling him the cutest kid on the internet and I can&amp;rsquo;t disagree. üòç Sorry, Taimur. He has almost 200k likes on Facebook.
He originally appeared in a viral video saying &amp;ldquo;Ye mera basta hai&amp;rdquo; (Translation: This is my bag) which then led to him appearing on national TV in Karachi on the show &amp;lsquo;Good Morning Pakistan&amp;rsquo; on ARY Digital with Nida Yasir.</description>
