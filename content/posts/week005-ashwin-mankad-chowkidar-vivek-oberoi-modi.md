If this post goes up later than usual I blame India for destroying the satellite handling my internet connection. Modi is back in the news with an address to the nation after taking a brief step back thanks to IPL. Let's recap this week.

## Main Bhi Chowkidar

I don't know if you've heard but apparently we all are watchmen. Watchwomen? Watchpeople? Yeah I can't translate chowkidar without sounding sexist. But Modi said it so it must be true. I believe everything he says to be as true as the Bible. :wink:

Modi's #MainBhiChowkidar campaign reminded some of this classic ad:

## Vivek Oberoi as Modi

Vivek Oberoi who is best known for his press conference against Salman Khan plays Narendra Modi in a new biopic on India's Prime Minister (who incidentally has not held a single press conference during his tenure). The irony was not lost on Twitter at all.

## Ashwin Mankads Jos Butler

In Lagaan, Tipu was run out for backing up too much while at non-striker's end. 150 years later, Ashwin managed to avenge him by using the same Mankad technique to run out England batsman Jos Butler.

Bonus points for using this against the smug-faced Piers Morgan.
