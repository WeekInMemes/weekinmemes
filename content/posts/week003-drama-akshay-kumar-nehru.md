## Most dramatic scene ever

There's nothing like Indian soap operas. The overacting, the black-and-white images, the quick camera cuts and of course, a fight between mother-in-law and her daughter-in-law. Twitter user [@ndreamon](https://twitter.com/ndreamon) shared a clip from Sasural Simar Ka on Mar 09, 2019 which somehow fit in all the best parts of an Indian TV drama into 7 seconds. Check it out:

## Akshay Kumar is on fire

25 years ago, Akshay Kumar danced with Raveena Tandon to the lyrics "Tip Tip Barsa Paani, Paani Ne Aage Lagayi". Last week it finally happened. His wife was clearly not impressed. The reaction might have been worse if it was Raveena Tandon's fault again though. :grin:

## Nehru stole the Rafale files

India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru is to be blamed for everything that goes wrong in the country. Everyone knows that. So when the government "lost" files related to Rafale scam he was the obvious culprit. The fact that he has been dead for 50 years is inconsequential. Classic black and white memes surfaced as a result. Like this one:
