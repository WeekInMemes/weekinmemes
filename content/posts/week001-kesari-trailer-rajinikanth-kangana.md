## Akshay Kumar in Kesari Trailer

The trailer for Akshay Kumar and Parineeti Chopra starrer Kesari released on Feb 20, 2019 and as is common these days, it was followed by a spate of memes. The line "Chal Jhootha" (*translation: Dream on!*) by Akshay Kumar became the common punchline for these memes. Like this one by Jaipur Police to raise awareness on drunk driving
