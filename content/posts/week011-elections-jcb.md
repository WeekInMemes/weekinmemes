The elections are finally over that means Vivek Oberoi's Narendra Modi biopic can be released... But instead of watching the movie, Indians prefer watching JCB machines dig. Seriously.

## Elections

Now that the elections are over, we're celebrating in our own way - by sharing memes. Apparently so is Smriti Irani

Of course, this wasn't the only reference to the recently concluded Game of Thrones. Some comparisons are inevitable:

## JCB Memes

To be honest, no one really knows. What we do know is that Indians are fascinated by the yellow digging machines, specifically the ubiquitous ones sold under the JCB brand. It's like mineral water is 'Bisleri' or photocopy is 'Xerox' in India, these machines are now JCB.

On May 27, 2019, Twitter users almost spontaneously started making memes about this phenomenon of Indians gathering to watch JCB machines at work like this one.

... and then there were memes by people wondering why there are JCB memes in the first place. A rare viral cycle :laughing:

But, the term #JCBKiKhudai was trending on top in India and made to Twitter Moments.


Maybe it started with Sunny Leone, who knows
