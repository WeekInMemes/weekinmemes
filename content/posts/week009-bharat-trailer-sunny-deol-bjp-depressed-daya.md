## Depressed Daya

CID memes have always been popular with some even making a career out of it *cough* rvcj *cough*. ACP Pradyuman shouting 'Daya! Darwaza Tod Do' before he breaks open a door or him slapping a confession out of an accused have been meme-d before. This new emo side of him is new but sometimes you can hit two birds with one stone or in Daya's case break two doors with one shoulder.
