## How's The Josh?

Since the movie Uri released on Jan 11, 2019, the line "How's The Josh?" has become a meme. Since the movie was about India's 'surgical strike' against terrorists in Pakistan, when India conducted an air strike in the Balakot region of Pakistan on Feb 25, 2019, the line came back in many more memes. Like this one showing Imran Khan in a hospital:

## GD Bakshi

Major General GD Bakshi spoke at the Indoi Analytics Conclave held at Constitution Club on Jan 14, 2019. In an epic rant against Pakistani soldiers entering Indian territory, he screamed "Yeh koi randi khana hai?" *(translation: Is this some brothel?)*

Twitter user [@AMIT_GUJJU](https://twitter.com/AMIT_GUJJU/) first shared this clip from the video.

It has become a reaction GIF to any display of debauchery.
