## Origin

During the India vs. Pakistan match in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 on Jun 16, 2019, Sarfaraz Ahmed, the captain and wicketkeeper for Pakistan was seen yawning. In an otherwise tense match, this was a light moment which made its way to memes.

It reminded a lot of people how Monday mornings usually go after a weekend of waking up late...
