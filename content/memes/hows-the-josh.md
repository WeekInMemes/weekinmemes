## Origin

In the movie Uri: The Surgical Strike, starring Vicky Kaushal and Yami Gautam, Vicky while leading a surgical strikes mission asks his troops, "How's the josh?" to which his team replies "High, Sir!"

Since the movie came out, on Jan 11, 2019, the line has become popular as a way to get an audience pumped up. 

India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi while addressing an audience of Bollywood stars (including Vicky Kaushal) also asked them, "How's the josh?" to which they replied "High, Sir!"

After another 'surgical strike' by India on terror camps in Balakot, Pakistan on Feb 25, 2019, variations of the meme were trending on twitter. The terror outfit attacked is called "Jaish-e-Mohammed" which led to many tweets containing "How's the Jaish?"


Director, Aditya Dhar explained the origin in [this interview](https://www.msn.com/en-sg/entertainment/bollywood/uri-director-aditya-dhar-explains-the-origin-of-hows-the-josh/ar-BBTexsH?li=AAgfYGb).

> I had some friends from defence background, so with them, I used to go to a lot of Army clubs. There was one in Delhi where we used to go for Christmas or New Year parties. There used to be a retired Brigadier who would line up all the kids in front of him and have a chocolate in his hand.
>He would say "Howâ€™s the josh?" and we were to respond with "High Sir!" The kid who was the loudest got the chocolate. Being a foodie, I used to be the loudest and always got the chocolate!
