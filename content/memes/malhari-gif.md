## Origin


The gif of Ranveer Singh dancing among Maratha soldiers is taken from the video Malhari from the movie Bajirao Mastani.

{{< youtube l_MyUGq7pgs >}}


The gif from Malhari has become a popular 'celebration' among the reddit and especially the bitcoin community. As /u/Oracle_of_Knowledge mentions in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7huxnh/12k_que_the_music_release_the_memes/dqu8h5d/)

> On Bitcoinity.com when there is a new milestone All Time High they will often post a gif.
> A gif of this (1:26 in the video, his re-entrance) was up on Bitconity for the $4000 USD all time high. I think that was the first occurrence that I ever saw of it.
