## Origin

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other BJP leaders have, in the past, blamed a lot of the current problems India faces on the first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.

On Mar 06, 2019, documents containing details of the deal between the Indian government and Dassault Aviation for the purchase of Rafale aircrafts were stolen, according to the Attorney General of India.

Twitter went into overdrive digging out old images of Nehru to blame him for this latest mischief.
