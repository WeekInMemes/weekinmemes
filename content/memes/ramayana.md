## Origin

The government of India's solution to make the lockdown caused by Coronavirus is to bring back old TV shows from the 80s and 90s. 

Prakash Javdekar, the minister for Information and Broadcasting announced on March 27 that Ramayana would be aired everyday at 9 am and 9 pm on DD National. The 2 Hindu epics - Ramayana and Mahabharata - were the most popular shows then and were the most anticipated ones for a generation that grew up watching them.
