## Origin

The Pooja Misrra and Shonali Nagrani fight on Bigg Boss has come back as a viral video.

Watch the fight:

Thanks to the very friendly people on wikipedia who kept a record of every episode of Bigg Boss, we know that this happened on the Day 12 episode of Bigg Boss Season 5 (aired in 2011-12).

On Mar 27, 2019, Twitter user [@intorubyjane](https://twitter.com/intorubyjane) shared the video as "Indian Bad Girls Club" on Twitter.

Since then I can't stop myself saying "Pooja what is this behaviour?" or  "You're asking for it! You're dying for it" to anyone's slightly wayward behaviour. So does this guy apparently:

Also if my child does not do this, they're probably not my child:

And um whatever is going on here:

Another user [@rukhsxr_](https://twitter.com/rukhsxr_) made a thread of all of Pooja's 'behaviours' like this: 

{{< tweet 1122502007582068738 >}}

Go watch the entire thread. I have no words to describe it. There seems to be a pattern in this behaviour that might do wih some help. Like [this article](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/banned-from-the-house-because-i-am-single-says-former-bigg-boss-contestant-pooja-misrra/articleshow/50545977.cms) that talks about how residents of the building she was living in also didn't like her behaviour.
