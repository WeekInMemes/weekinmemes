## Origin

Another Ramayana meme has become viral. This time it is the scene where Hanuman carries the mountain with Sanjeevani Booti.
<!--more-->

According to the Ramayana, when Laxman (Rama's brother) gets injured in the war against Ravana, Rama asks Hanuman to retrieve Sanjeevani Booti (an all-healing herb). When Hanuman reaches the mountain with the herb, he uses his superhuman strength to lift the entire mountain and bring it to Laxman.

The scene depicted in the TV show Ramayana with 80s CGI graphics made for great meme material.
