## Origin

This scene is from the Dec 14, 2017 episode. Watch the full episode here:

Mataji (Jayati Bhatia) slaps Pari (Shweta Sinha) to which Pari reacts in the only way Indian soap actors can - with exaggeration. The slap is so powerful she loses her balance and begins to hang herself from a curtain. 

I can't believe I just wrote all of that. Please watch the entire video for more details because I could not.
