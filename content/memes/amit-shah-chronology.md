In the video released on April 23, 2019, at around 0:18 Amit Shah says, "Aap Chronology Samajhiye".

The Citizenship Amendment Act which was passed by the Parliament on December 11, 2019 has led to protests across the country. Journalist Shivam Vij ([@DilliDurAst](https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst)) shared this clip from the video.

The line "Aap Chronology Samajhiye" has since then become a meme.
