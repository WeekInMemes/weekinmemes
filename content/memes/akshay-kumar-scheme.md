## Origin

Akshay Kumar Schemeposting is a Facebook group that is focused on memes featuring Akshay Kumar. The scheme in Schemeposting is based on Akhsay Kumar's character in the 2007 movie, Phir Hera Pheri (sequel to Hera Pheri). In the movie, Raju (Akshay Kumar) falls for a money-making scheme and then tries to sell similar schemes to other gullible people like Rajpal Yadav as shown in this template:
