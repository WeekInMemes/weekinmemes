## Origin

The trailer for Akshay Kumar and Parineeti Chopra starrer Kesari released on Feb 20, 2019 and as is common these days, it was followed by a spate of memes. The line "Chal Jhootha" *(translation: Dream on!)* by Akshay Kumar became the common punchline for these memes.

In the trailer, at the [2:09](https://youtu.be/JFP24D15_XM?t=129) mark, an old man claims the opposition army will defeat the Sikh Army (led by Akshay Kumar) to which Akshay Kumar wryly replies "Chal Jhootha" *(translation: Dream on!)*

The common theme among all memes is of someone making a tall claim which is put down by the line "Chal Jhootha".
