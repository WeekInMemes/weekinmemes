## Origin

In the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) vs. Mumbai Indians (MI) on Mar 28 2019 at the M.Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru, MI won in the last over. With 7 runs required from the last ball, Malinga bowled what looked like a no-ball but wasn't called by the umpires.

This led to a flurry of memes most of which focused on how Ambani "bought" the game with his bottomless pit of money. Like this one:
