## Origin

To be honest, no one really knows. What we do know is that Indians are fascinated by the yellow digging machines, specifically the ubiquitous ones sold under the JCB brand. It's like mineral water is 'Bisleri' or photocopy is 'Xerox' in India, these machines are now JCB.

On May 27, 2019, Twitter users almost spontaneously started making memes about this phenomenon of Indians gathering to watch JCB machines at work. Probably it's the lull between 2 big events - Indian elections and the World Cup - that is the cause of this completely random trend. But, the term #JCBKiKhudai was trending on top in India and made to Twitter Moments and even the official JCB handle had to respond:

First there were memes on people watching JCB dig

... and then there were memes by people wondering why there are JCB memes in the first place. A rare viral cycle :laughing:

A twitter user tried to explain that it's because of how many people view youtube videos of JCB digging.

This is the first video in the tweet above and it really has 4million+ views:

Another theory is that it started with Sunny Leone, who knows
