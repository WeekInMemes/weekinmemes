## Origin

A kid from Pakistan has recently become a viral sensation for his video. Watch the video here:

His name is Ahmad Shah and some are calling him the cutest kid on the internet and I can't disagree. :heart_eyes: Sorry, Taimur. He has almost 200k likes on Facebook.

He originally appeared in a viral video saying "Ye mera basta hai" (*Translation: This is my bag*) which then led to him appearing on national TV in Karachi on the show 'Good Morning Pakistan' on ARY Digital with Nida Yasir.
