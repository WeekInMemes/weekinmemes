## Origin

The trailer for Imtiaz Ali's next movie titled Love Aaj Kal (yes the same title as his 2009 movie) released on Jan 16, 2020. Watch the trailer here:

Thanks to nepotism, Sara Ali Khan is in yet another movie. If that wasn't bad enough, Kartik Aryan plays the character played by Sara Ali Khan's father, Saif Ali Khan, in the original movie. So instead of one we get 2 Kartik Aryans, one of whom is romancing Sara Ali Khan. Totally not weird.

The first look and trailer received mixed reactions but the memes were received well like this one:
