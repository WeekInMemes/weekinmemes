# Support Week In Memes

You can support WeekInMemes without spending a dime! Even better, when you support using either of the following channels, you get paid too!

## BAT tips

The easiest way to support is via tips in Basic Action Token (BAT), a cryptocurrency for publishers. If you use the Brave browser, you can tip by clicking on the BAT icon on the top right corner and clicking "Send a tip"

You can download the browser using my referral link: https://brave.com/wee460 I get $5 worth of BAT for each referral.


## Sweatcoin referral

Get paid to walk. This app pays you in a cryptocurrency called "Sweatcoin". 1000 steps = 1 sweatcoin. There isn't an official exchange to convert sweatcoin to fiat currency (like dollars or rupees) but will be available soon! 

To show your support you can download the Sweatcoin app using my referral link: https://sweatco.in/hi/weekinmemes I get 5 sweatcoins per referral.
